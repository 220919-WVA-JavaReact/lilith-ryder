                <h4>Bio</h4>
                <p>Lilith Ryder, 28, of Niagara Falls NY, is a technology enthusiast and budding software developer. 
                    Born in San Antonio, Texas, she was raised by her parents, an eccentric duo of an Aerospace Engineer(her father, Kurt) 
                    and Anthropologist(her mother, Theresa). Aspiring originally to become an engineer like her father, she attended 
                    Texas A&M University Corpus Christi as a Mechanical Engineering student, until her precarious financial situation led her to 
                    accept a contract with the US Army National Guard. Her scholarship program was cancelled and after three years of service in the Guard,
                    she moved to Buffalo NY where she pursued various jobs in electronics repair and studied software engineering in her spare time.</p>
