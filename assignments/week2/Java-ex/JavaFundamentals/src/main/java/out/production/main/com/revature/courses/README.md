# Goals for Today

Build a basic console application for teachers to register and sign up for teaching courses. There are a few user stories we want to be aware of while building:

* We should be able to register/login as a teacher.
* We should be able to enroll to teach some course.
* Information should be persisted to some sort of csv files or something similar.
